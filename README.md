# resume

Over-engineered resume built with react, typescript, vitejs, puppeteer, and tailwindcss.

## Why?

I think it's a cool idea to build my resume using the same technologies that I use for my work!

I also wanted to try ViteJS and TailwindCSS.


ViteJS is a fast bundler that, honestly, turned out way faster than my previous webpack build system.

TailwindCSS is a CSS framework designed around utility-based CSS. I'm on the fence about it. It does result in smaller css but it's a bit verbose.
