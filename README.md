# resume

Over-engineered resume built with react, typescript, vitejs, puppeteer, and tailwindcss.

## Why?

I think it's a cool idea to build my resume using the same technologies that I use for my work!

I also wanted to use ViteJS and TailwindCSS

ViteJS is a fast bundler that, honestly, turned out way faster than my previous webpack build system.
TailwindCSS is a CSS framework designed around utility-based CSS.
